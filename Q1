What’s a default constructor? How are an object’s data members initialized if a 
class has only a default constructor defined by the compiler?

A default constructor is the constructor that is called when you create an object without specifying 
any arguments to a constructor. You can write a default constructor that initializes data members 
any way you choose. The compiler provides a default constructor with no parameters in any class 
that does not explicitly include a constructor. The default constructor provided by the compiler 
creates an object without assigning any initial values to the object’s fundamental type data 
members—data members must be initialized using the object’s member functions. Every constructor 
implicitly calls the constructors of any data member objects before the body of the class’s 
constructor executes.
